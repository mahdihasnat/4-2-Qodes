A spreadsheet simulation for single-server queueing system is to be done for output data analysis.

(1) Consider rho is 0.9 (if interarrival times has 60 seconds as mean, then the service time has a mean of 54 seconds) 
	and simulate for at least n =  1000 replications (runs) and each replications with at least m = 500 customers.

(2) The starting conditions should be varied with the number of customers, s = 0, 5, 10, 12, 15.
	 Here s represents the number in system at time zero.

(3) For each starting condition, show the plot of E(Di) for n = 250, 500, 750, 1000 
	replications in a single graph  considering m = 500 customers.

(4) Finally, show the plot of E(Di) for n = 1000 replications and m = 500 customers 
	for different starting conditions s in a single graph.
